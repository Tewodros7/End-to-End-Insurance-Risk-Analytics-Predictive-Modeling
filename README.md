#ðŸ§  Insurance Risk Analysis & Predictive Modeling (10 Academy â€“ AIM Week 3)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal of the Project
This project leverages South African auto insurance data to identify risk profiles and develop predictive models, empowering AlphaCare Insurance Solutions to:

Fine-tune pricing strategies for insurance premiums

Recognize safer drivers for possible premium discounts

Strengthen marketing efforts using insights rooted in data

##âœ… Key Milestones Achieved
### ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Version Control & Exploratory Analysis
-Set up GitHub repository with proper branching and history tracking

-Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to explore:

-Variations in risk (e.g., loss ratio) by location, vehicle class, and customer type

-Financial and vehicle-related outliers and data distribution

-Claim and premium patterns over time

-Highest and lowest claim-generating vehicle models

-Produced multiple compelling visualizations (3+)

###ðŸ“Œ Task 2: Data Versioning with DVC
-Installed and configured Data Version Control (DVC) for tracking data pipelines

-Managed and tracked the raw dataset with DVC

-Linked DVC with GitHub using .dvc files and remote storage setup

### ðŸ“Œ Task 3: Business Hypothesis Testing
-Constructed and evaluated four key hypotheses relevant to business decisions:

-Risk differences based on province, zip code, and gender

-Variance in profit margins by location

-Employed statistical techniques including t-tests and chi-squared tests

-Interpreted results (p-values) to derive business-relevant conclusions

### ðŸ“Œ Task 4: Machine Learning Modeling
-Developed predictive models for:

-Estimating claim costs (TotalClaims)

-Recommending premium adjustments

-(Optional) Classifying the likelihood of a claim

-Algorithms applied: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

-Evaluated performance using metrics like RMSE, RÂ², and classification scores

-Used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for interpreting feature importance
